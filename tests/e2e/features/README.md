# The Gherkin lane — conventions every feature author follows VERBATIM

This directory holds executable Gherkin. `npx bddgen` compiles it into Playwright
specs; the `bdd` project in `../playwright.config.ts` runs them. **A `.feature`
that does not generate and run does not count** — `tests/scripts/test-e2e-gherkin-harness.sh`
fails the build if one stops being picked up.

## 1. Layout — exact

```
tests/e2e/features/<domain>/<name>.feature   the Gherkin
tests/e2e/steps/world.ts                     THE single import entry point (hooks + fixtures)
tests/e2e/steps/dimensions.ts                ROLE / PLATFORM / SERVICE vocabulary
tests/e2e/steps/common.steps.ts              the SHARED step vocabulary — reuse, never redefine
tests/e2e/steps/<domain>.steps.ts            your step definitions (FLAT — no subdirectories)
tests/e2e/.features-gen/                     GENERATED. gitignored. never committed.
```

`<domain>` mirrors the handwritten spec domains: `onboarding`, `rbac`, `matrix`,
`mastodon`, `forum`, `games`, `federation`, `media`, `platform`.

Step-definition files are **flat** in `steps/` and end in `.steps.ts`, so the
import is always exactly:

```ts
import { Given, When, Then, requireDimension, substep } from './world';
```

**Never** `import { Given } from 'playwright-bdd'`. `createBdd(test)` binds hooks
and step definitions to one `test` instance; a second `createBdd()` call binds to
a different one, load ordering races, and the AfterStep screenshot hook silently
never fires. `world.ts` makes that call once for the whole suite.

## 2. The matrix: ROLE × PLATFORM × SERVICE

Three axes, one spelling. Values are validated in the `Before` hook — an unknown
value throws with the legal set before a browser action runs.

| axis | tag | legal values |
|---|---|---|
| ROLE | `@role:<persona-handle>` | any handle seeded by `specs/rbac-roles.ts` `SYSTEMS_SEED_USERS` **or** `tests/e2e-extra-personas.sh` |
| PLATFORM | `@platform:<target>` | `rpi5`, `x86` |
| SERVICE | `@service:<id>` | `tuwunel`, `akkoma`, `phpbb`, `games`, `owncast`, `tube`, `wiki`, `character-studio`, `character-forge`, `gateway`, `login`, `admin` |
| (reporting) | `@layer:<layer>` | `gateway`, `bff`, `homeserver`, `egress`, `casdoor`, `ui`, `sse` (`specs/report-tags.ts`) |

`@role:` names a **persona handle** (`e2e-admin`, `alice@gmail.com`), never a
`ROLE_*` string. A role is not an identity and cannot be logged in as.

### 2a. FIXED dimension → a Gherkin tag

```gherkin
@service:akkoma @platform:x86 @layer:ui
Feature: Mastodon timeline
  @role:e2e-mastodon
  Scenario: a platform-access persona posts to their home timeline
```

### 2b. VARYING dimension → an Examples column **and** the tag suffix in the name

The Examples column must be named exactly `role` / `platform` / `service`, and the
`Scenario Outline` **name must end with the matching `@axis:<column>` suffix**:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: <role> is denied the infra console @role:<role> @service:admin @layer:gateway
  ...
  Examples:
    | role     |
    | e2e-mod  |
    | e2e-user |
```

Why the suffix is mandatory and not cosmetic: Gherkin tags cannot carry
placeholders, so a varied axis cannot be a tag. playwright-bdd fills `<column>`
placeholders that appear in the **outline name** to build each example's test
title (`dist/generate/examplesTitleBuilder.js`), and the existing
`reporters/hugmesh-reporter.ts` pivots `summary.json`'s `perRole` / `perLayer`
off the **title**. Drop the suffix and every row of your matrix is bucketed
`role:unknown`. Measured, not assumed — see the `perRole` block in the unit
report.

Tags and title are both parsed; the title wins, because it is the per-example
value.

### 2c. Reading a dimension inside a step

```ts
Given('I am signed in as the persona for this scenario', async ({ page, dimensions }) => {
  const handle = persona(requireDimension(dimensions, 'role'));
  ...
});
```

`requireDimension` fails loudly when the scenario never declared the axis.

### 2d. What PLATFORM actually does at run time

A mesh under test is one image target at a time. `SNAP_PLATFORM=rpi5|x86` makes
the `Before` hook skip scenarios pinned to the *other* platform **with a named
reason** — they still appear in `--list`, and the skip is reported, never silent.
With `SNAP_PLATFORM` unset (the default) every platform row runs.

## 3. Steps

* Reuse `common.steps.ts` first. A duplicate step text is a hard generation error
  (`missingSteps: 'fail-on-gen'`), so you cannot shadow one by accident — but the
  fix is to reuse, not to reword.
* Step definitions **call the existing helpers** (`../specs/helpers`,
  `../specs/federation`, `../specs/rbac-roles`, `../specs/totp`, …). Do not
  reimplement login, seeding or navigation: the Gherkin must drive the same code
  the 33 handwritten specs drive, or the two lanes drift.
* Every Gherkin step is already a real Playwright `test.step()` (playwright-bdd
  wraps it). Use `substep('…', async () => {…})` from `world.ts` only to split a
  definition that does several distinguishable things.

## 4. Evidence

`AfterStep` writes, per Gherkin step:

```
${SNAP_REPORT_DIR:-test-results}/bdd-steps/<runId>/<feature>/<scenario>/NNN-<step>.png
                                                                        NNN-<step>.json
```

The `.json` sidecar carries `{feature, scenario, step, ordinal, role, platform,
service, layer, failed, at}`, and both are also `testInfo.attach`ed so they land
in the HTML report. Override the base with `SNAP_BDD_SHOTS`.

Evidence never goes to `tests/e2e/screenshots/` — that holds 38 git-tracked PNGs
which every legacy run overwrites in place, dirtying the working tree. Do not add
to that pattern.

## 5. Verify your feature before you commit

From `tests/e2e`:

```sh
npx bddgen && npx playwright test --list --project=bdd
bash ../scripts/test-e2e-gherkin-harness.sh
```

or, from the repo root, `make stack-e2e-bdd-check` (generation + the guard, no
stack needed). `make stack-e2e-bdd` runs the lane against a live stack.

If `bddgen` exits non-zero your feature uses a step nobody defined — that is the
anti-decoration gate doing its job. Define the step or fix the wording; never
delete the assertion.
